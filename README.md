## Requirements
* python 3.8+

Linux users will have to install a [resource opener](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/default_applications#Resource_openers) package, a utility to open directories, html pages, etc. **PyRadio** will look for *xdg-open*, *gio*, *mimeopen*, *mimeo* or *handlr*, in that order of detection. If a different *resource opener* is used, one can declare it in the **Configuration Window**.

## Installation

The best way to install **PyRadio** is via a distribution package, if one exists (*Arch Linux* and derivatives can install [any of these packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=pyradio) from the AUR, *FreeBSD* users will find it in the [ports](https://www.freshports.org/audio/py-pyradio/), etc.).

In any other case you will have to [build it from source](docs/build.md).

**Note:** Please avoid installing **PyRadio** via **pip**. I (user [s-n-g](https://github.com/s-n-g) @ github) am not the creator of this project, nor do I maintain it on [The Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pyradio/). As a result, the version available there is outdated and I cannot provide any support for it. \
\
Furthermore, please refrain from using any third-party packaging methods, such as **Snap** or **AppImage**. I am not affiliated with these services or projects, and I cannot guarantee the functionality or version of **PyRadio** provided through them. Additionally, I am unable to offer support for any issues related to these packaging methods. \
\
In any of the above cases, if you do ask for help, I will ask you to install your distro package (or build **PyRadio** from source), before attempting to provide any further help.

## Basic usage

After a successful installation, the command to execute is:

    pyradio

This will display the program's window with a list of predefined radio stations ready to be played.

 - Select one of the station (using the arrow keys) and press "**ENTER**" to start playback.

- Press "**+**" (or "**.**") and "**-**" (or "**,**") to adjust the volume, and "**v**" to save it.

- Pressing "**?**" will give you access to the help screens; "**\\h**" will give you access to the HTML help pages.

- "**Esc**" or "**q**" will exit the program.

In case the list of predefined stations is not enough for you, you can press "**O**" (capital "**o**") to access **RadioBrowser** online directory; you will probably have to read [this page](docs/radio-browser.md) to learn how to navigate the interface.

**PyRadio** comes with a number of themes; press "**t**" to get a list of themes, and

- press the **right arrow** to activate the selected theme, and...

- when you find a theme you like, press **space** to make it default. \
\
To get more info on theming, including how to create your own, read the [relevant page](docs/themes.md).

Finally, when you are ready to dive into the program's numerous features, you can refer to the [detailed documentation](docs/index.md).

## Update notification

**PyRadio** will periodically (once every 10 days) check whether a new version has been released.

If so, a notification message will be displayed, informing the user about it and asking to proceed with updating the program (provided this is not a distribution package).

**Note:** Packages coming from a distribution repository will display no notification; it's up to the distro to update / uninstall **PyRadio**, as stated in [Packaging PyRadio](docs/packaging.md).

## Reporting bugs

When a bug is found, please do report it by [opening an issue at github](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/issues), as already stated above.

In you report you should, at the very least, state your **pyradio version**, **python version** and **method** of installation (built from source, AUR, snap, whatever).

It would be really useful to include **~/pyradio.log** in your report.

To create it, enter the following commands in a terminal:

    $ rm ~/pyradio.log
    $ pyradio -d

Then try to reproduce the bug and exit **pyradio**.

Finally, include the file produced in your report.

## Packaging PyRadio
